    <h1>Paste Recipe</h1>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Making fresh pasta at home is easy. It does not require more than a roller
      to stretch it and a knife to cut it. You can customize it, it has more
      flavor and texture, and it produces a sense of accomplishment that won't
      take away for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of fresh base pasta. On the one hand, the one that is
      made with durum wheat flour and water, once formed, let it dry. On the
      other hand, fresh egg pasta. The latter is made with loose flour and
      requires the addition of egg (protein) in order to give cohesion to the
      dough itself as well as elasticity.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>- 400g spaghetti</li>
      <li>- 2 eggs</li>
      <li>- 150g of cured cheese (Parmesan, Manchegoâ€¦)</li>
      <li>- 120g of bacon or pancetta</li>
      <li>- salt and pepper</li>
      <li>- a little drizzle of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We put a handful of salt (generous) in plenty of boiling water. Then we
        add the spaghetti and let them cook here for about 10 minutes. until
        they are al dente. They should be stirred frequently, especially at the
        beginning of cooking, so that they do not stick.
      </li>
      <li>
        While they cook, prepare the carbonara. In a bowl add the egg yolks. It
        is better to save the white for another preparation since, if we add it,
        it will look more like a spaghetti omelette than a sauce itself. But if
        you don't mind, you can add it. We also add the grated cheese and mix
        both ingredients with a fork. There will be a kind of very dense mass
        and this will be the carbonara.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a frying pan we put a small drizzle of oil. When it is very hot, add
        the bacon or pancetta, cut into rather small cubes. After a couple of
        minutes, when they are fried, remove from the heat and reserve
      </li>
      <li>
        Once this is done and when the spaghetti is cooked, we save a few ladles
        of the cooking broth. Then we drain the spaghetti from the rest of the
        broth
      </li>
      <li>
        Without delay, since it will be the residual heat of the spaghetti that
        will cook the carbonara, we put the pasta in the bowl where we had
        prepared it. Add the bacon, with the toy that they have been able to
        release and a little of the cooking broth. We remove everything well
        with a fork so that the spaghetti absorbs all the sauce. If you see that
        it is very dense, you can add more cooking broth, until you have a very
        creamy sauce (don't forget to stir everything vigorously. Pasta is very
        porous and absorbs sauce relatively easily. But it needs to be stirred
        to help This process)
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, when we have achieved the desired creaminess of the sauce,
        sprinkle with plenty of freshly ground black pepper. It is said that the
        name "carbonara" comes from the color that this spice gives it, which is
        reminiscent of the color of coal. serve immediately

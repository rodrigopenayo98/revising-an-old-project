    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="lasaña.jpg" alt="" />
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      This kitchen classic is famous all over the world, not just in Italy.
      Ideal to take in the taper to work or school, and that undoubtedly
      triumphs among the little ones at home. Do not go overboard with the
      quantity, one portion is enough, a fairly complete recipe and it gives you
      to overcome a day full of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I always recommend is to use quality ingredients, from the pasta, in
      this case the Garofalo lasagna, one of the best pastas in Italy. And of
      course, the fillings, today meat, but you have many ways to fill it.
      Following the recipe you can make lasagna with vegetables, the classic
      lasagna with tuna or lasagna with fish, which is a great option, tuna,
      hake, even combine it with seafood.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>12 sheets of lasagna or Garofalo lasagna</li>
      <li>To make the béchamel: (for a liter or so, enough for the lasagna): 125 g of all-purpose wheat flour</li>
      <li>125g butter</li>
      <li>1 liter of whole milk</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste of each house)</li>
      <li>To finish and gratin the lasagna: 100-120 g. grated Grana Padano cheese (or mix with your favorite cheese to gratin)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We heat a large pot of water, the widest at home. When it starts to boil add 2 generous handfuls of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        We introduce the lasagna sheets one by one without touching each other (so that they do not stick together). Now we can find countless types of lasagna where it is not hydrated as it was done before. At home many times to save time I use those that are hydrated with the béchamel and the juice that the sauce releases when baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do it in the traditional way we have to stir with a wooden spoon and in about 10 minutes we remove the sheets. We stretch them on top of some sheets of absorbent kitchen paper. Although it seems to you that they are not there, they will end up being made in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        The next step will be to wash all the vegetables that we are going to use in the filling very well. In the recipe I recommend the filling of the classic Bolognese sauce, carrots, garlic, peppers and onion.
